# Heroes of Pymoli

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

# Observable Trends
* Although majority of players are male (84.03%), the females spend the most on optional items.
* The age group that represents the majority of the data is 20 - 24, but they do not average the most spending on optional items.
* If the company were aiming to persuade a certain group to purchase optional items, they would want to target males in the age range of 20 - 24 as they represent the majority of the sample.
